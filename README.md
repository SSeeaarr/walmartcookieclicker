So essentially this is me learning godot so the game is kinda stupid and probably breakable but thats fine.
This is just a very barebones cookieclicker clone so that I can sort of get the grasp of how godot syntax and objects are.

i would love to make more complex games in the future :)



so this is quite literally what it looks like lol
